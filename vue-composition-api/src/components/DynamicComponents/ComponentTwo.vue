    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a language used to control the presentation of HTML or XML documents. It allows you to specify how elements should be displayed, including color, fonts, spacing, and positioning. Essentially, CSS separates the visual presentation of a web page from its structural content, which is defined in HTML.
